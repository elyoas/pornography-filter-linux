# E2GUARDIAN weightedphraselist INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE

# New in v5.2 - per cent feature

# If weighting is a % then that % of the naughtynesslimit is used as the weight
# e.g.  
# < slut ><10%>
# - If naughtynesslimit is 200 will add 20 to the count against the word 'slut'
#
# This allows phrases to be used which will have the same effect in all
# filtergroups

#
# Examples:
#
# <slut><10>			
# - Adds 10 to the count against the string 'slut'.   ie. sluts, slut!, abslutxyz.
#
# < slut ><10>
# - Adds 10 to the count against the word 'slut'.   ie. Sally is a slut that smells.
#
# <slut>,<horny><50>
# - Adds 50 to the count when the strings 'slut' and 'horny' are found on the same page.
#
# <breast>,<medical><-30>
# - Subtracts 30 from the count when 'breast' and 'medical' are on the one page.
#
# <education><-25>
# - Subtracts 25 from the count when 'education' is on the page.
#
# See the bannedphraselist for more examples.
